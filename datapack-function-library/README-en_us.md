*This datapack is licensed under the [GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.txt "Go to this open source license page").*

**This datapack provides developers with some practical functions (and some dialogs), compatible with all versions of Minecraft (except for versions that cannot install datapacks).**

**However, due to the large number of commands involved in the datapack, lower versions may not be able to use all functions. The applicable versions of all functions will not be specified below.**

**Please install the resource pack at the same time to use localized content (v3.2+). Otherwise, the datapack language will default to zh_cn.**

**The mod version of this datapack is packaged through Modrinth, and the content is exactly the same as the datapack version, but it is not necessarily the latest version. Please try to use the datapack version.**

**This datapack provides a `dfl:dfl_enable` function, which can set the score of all entities in this scoreboard to 1, which is convenient for datapacks or mods that depend on this datapack to detect whether this datapack is loaded.**

**Example:**

```mcfunction
#Execute when the datapack is loaded:
scoreboard objectives add dfl_enable dummy
scoreboard players set @e dfl_enable 0
#If not loaded:
function dfl:dfl_enable
execute unless score @n dfl_enable matches 1
#If loaded:
function dfl:dfl_enable
execute if score @n dfl_enable matches 1
```

**Note: Some functions have "prerequisite functions" attached to their usage. These functions must be executed once before executing them.**

**Some function usages are followed by `{xx:"xx"}`. These functions are [macro functions](https://zh.minecraft.wiki/w/Java%E7%89%88%E5%87%BD%E6%95%B0#%E5%AE%8F). When using them, you need to pass parameters through `{<parameter name>:"<content>"}` (the parameters in the usage are the recommended parameters tested by the author during development, or the parameters used by the author for testing). The parameter name (such as num) is expressed as: {num} in the text. The parameter format can refer to the function usage, and special formats will be explained.**
